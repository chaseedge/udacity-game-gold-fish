#Full Stack Nanodegree Project 4

## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
1.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.
1.  (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
 Deploy your application.



##Game Description:
Go Fish is the classic card game. Users register and are able to challenge
other users to the game. Each game begins with two players. Players
are dealt a certain number of cards (default is 5). Each player will take turns
asking for cards from the other player with the goal being get matches. Player
guesses are sent to the 'make_move' endpoint
which checks the other players hand for the guessed card.

The game is played until a player runs out of cards or gets a target number of
matches (default is 6). Set cards_dealt to a high number (e.g. 10) and
matches_to_win (e.g. 2) for games to go faster.

Many different Go Fish games can be played by many different Users at any
given time, but Users can only have one active game against each other User at
at any given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter
`urlsafe_game_key`.

Uses memcache to update User's scores.

Game has a bias towards whoever goes first.
