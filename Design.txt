I took the Guess Number Game and changed it into a game of Gold Fish.
This was pretty much a total rework of the Guess Number Game. I used a couple
of the forms and utility functions from the old game, but for the most part, I
created an entirely new game.

The game is just like the traditional card game. One of the challenges I faced
was how to handle the deck of cards and the players hands. I could have kept
everything in the Game Model, but decided to use another model named Player.
I did this for multiple reasons:
    - Thought it would make the code more readable
    - Instead of having a player1, player1_hand, player1_matches, player2, etc.,
    I thought it would be better to have the player names and who's turn it is
    saved in the Game Entity and just look up the Player when needed.

Instead of logging each move made in the Game Model, I made a separate Move Model.
I did this to make Game Model quicker because there is no need to bring in all moves
in a game each time a Game Model entity was queried. 

Since this is more than just a guessing game, I had to add an endpoint to
handle the card game aspect with get_player_hand.

To improve on the game, I could add a feature to handle ties. Currently it is
whoever hits the number of matches first or runs out of cards. The biases is
towards Player1 because their matches are checked first.
I could also change how the scoreboard is handled. Currently, users are ranked
based on number of wins and disregards how many losses the user has. It could
be changed to look at a win ratio and number of games played.
